**Sowlus Simkus (Photography website)**


This is my photographpy website which I created after I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I only used external code for Lightbox gallery.

The rest is coded by me.

Media query still needs adjustments, especiallly when viewing in a horizontal position on mobile or tablet.

The live webiste is on www.sowlusimkus.com
